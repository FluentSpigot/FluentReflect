    FluentReflect is a Java library designed to simplify the usage of reflection in Java programs.
    With FluentReflect, developers can easily search for and manipulate
</text>

<list>
    <text>classes</text>
    <text>fields</text>
    <text>methods</text>
    <text>contructors</text>
    <text>enums</text>
</list>
</br>
<text>
   without having to write verbose and complex reflection code.
</text>
</br>
<text>
    One of the key features of FluentReflect is its fluent interface, which allows developers
    to chain together multiple reflection operations in a concise and readable manner.
    For example, to find a specific class, developers can use the findClass()
    method and then chain together various options to narrow down the search,
    such as specifying the Java version and the class name.

<text>
    FluentReflect also includes a number of convenience methods for common reflection operations,
    such as getting and setting field values and invoking methods. Additionally, the library provides
    a number of utilities for working with annotations, including searching for
    annotated classes and fields and reading annotation values.
